# Java-RMI-Practice
The aim of this project is to practice Java RMI.

By using Java RMI, I made this program, provided with Main Server, Intermediate Server, and finally the Client Side.
The main server has 3 different branches, if one of them updated the prices of the tickets, its all forwarded to the other branches as well as the client.
Client can choose which branch he would like to retrieve the prices from.
